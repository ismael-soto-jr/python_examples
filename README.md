# python_examples
This contains example data science Python code I wrote using Jupyter Notebook. I will be adding more files soon.

Feel free to use some of my code if it may help you with your work and/or make any suggestions for improvement.

Topics include: data wrangling, string manipulation methods (such as regular expressions), working with dates, datatype manipulations, and more. I have used much of the code previewed here to clean data and conduct actual analysis.
